# 🏗️ Build Your Own Shell Challenge

This is a repository for C# solutions to the ["Build Your Own Shell" challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

## 📋 Introduction

Welcome to the Build your own Shell challenge!

A shell is a command-line interface that executes commands and manages processes. In this challenge, you'll build your own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like cd, pwd, echo and more.

Along the way, you'll learn about shell command parsing, REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

## 🛠️ Run

1. Ensure you have `dotnet (9.0)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program
